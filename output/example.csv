How do organizations align employee appraisals and rewards with their business processes?,"This work discusses the critical factors that are important for a successful BPM-HRM alignment and provides recommendations for this
alignment by differentiating between lower and higher levels of BPM maturity.","While the BPM literature highlights the importance of aligning HRM appraisals and rewards to business processes, little is known about how organizations actually align these two areas in practice, and how they face the challenges of this alignment.",This exploratory case study approach has offered empirical evidence of how organizations align their employee appraisals and rewards to their particular business process context. We observed four patterns that organizations can use to ensure the required BPM-HRM alignment.,Inductive study,Meta-analysis,Social science theory,Theory,No,No,No,,,Report,Case Study,Literature Analysis,Case Study,,Real-world data,14,0.0,14,No,,"Yes, via reference",Grounded Theory,,,,Construct Validity,External Validity,Internal Validity,,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
